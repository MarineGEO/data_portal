The table below contains the invalid ID value and location within the data sheet. It is likely that either a typo occurred or a sampling location was not properly defined in the ""sample_metadata"" sheet. "
Invalid ID value in sample metadata,qa warning,"The protocol's sample metadata sheet has ID variables (such as site code, location name, and transect) that do not appear elsewhere on the data sheets. Check to make sure this does not reflect an error. If you received an alert for ""ID relationships (1)"", it is likely that you entered an ID variable one way in the sample metadata sheet and another way on a data sheet. For example, writing ""USA-MDA"" on one sheet and ""USA_MDA"" on another. In other cases, this may merely represent that you didn't collect data for that site/location/transect and this warning can be disregarded. "
