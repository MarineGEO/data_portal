## Data Submission Report
#### Report date: `r as.character(Sys.Date())`
#### Submitted by `r as.character(input$email)`

Thank you for submitting data to MarineGEO! We've received data associated with the following protocols: 

<br />

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}

kable(output_metadata$protocol %>%
        mutate(protocol = gsub("_", " ", protocol)) %>%
        select(-site) %>%
        rename(Protocol = protocol,
               Filename = filename))

```

<br />

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}

csv_submissions <- QA_results$df %>%
  filter(test == "CSV file")

failed_submissions <- QA_results$df %>%
  filter(test == "Invalid or missing protocol name" |
         test ==  "Upload failed initial processing") %>%
  filter(!filename %in% csv_submissions$filename)

if("sed-biome" %in% output_metadata$protocol$protocol){
  
  cat("Thank you for submitting data for the SED-BIOME project! If you did not submit the hobo logger temperature data with this submission, please email it to marinegeo-data@si.edu. If you did submit hobo logger data alongside the data entry spreadsheet, then your submission is complete!")
  
} else {
  
  if(nrow(failed_submissions) > 0){
    
    cat("MarineGEO received but was unable to process the following files:", 
        "\n", "\n")
    
    print(kable(failed_submissions %>%
                  rename(Filename = filename) %>%
                  select(Filename) %>%
                  distinct()))
    
    cat("We'll review these files and, if necessary, will reach out to data submitters with additional information or instructions. If you have any questions or concerns regarding this submission, please email us at  marinegeo-data@si.edu.")
  } else {

# This report documents whether the data submission passes MarineGEO's quality assurance/quality control tests. If your submission failed one of the tests, you can view which protocol and sheet failed the test. Please update your data to fix any issues based on this information. If you cannot determine how to interpret a result, modify your data, or believe your data should be able to pass the tests, email MarineGEO (marinegeo-data@si.edu). 
# 
# Once you've addressed any issues(s), resubmit ONLY the data associated with the failed submission. 
# 
#   <br />
# 
# ### QA/QC Test Results
# 
# If any files failed a QA test, the following table will describe which uploaded file, sheet, column, row, and value (if applicable) triggered the errors. You can read a description of each test in the section beneath the table. 

# if(nrow(QA_results$df) > 0){
#   report_warnings <- filter(warnings, title %in% QA_results$df$test)
#   
#   print(   
#     kable(
#       QA_results$df %>%
#         select(test, filename, sheet, column, rows, values) %>%
#         distinct()
#     )
#   )
#   
#   cat("\n", "\n")
# 
# }



```

```{r echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
  
# # Provide definitions of any failed tests
# 
# if(nrow(QA_results$df) > 0){
#   
#   cat("### Explanation of Test Results",

#   report_warnings <- filter(warnings, title %in% QA_results$df$test)
