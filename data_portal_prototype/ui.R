                        to accelerate the pace of discovery in coastal wetland science by providing the community with access to data, 
                        open source analysis tools, and data synthesis opportunities. A major component of these efforts is to network 
                        and disseminate previously-collected data, both for CCRCN research efforts and for use by the community. 
                        Many of such data are previously published, or otherwise publically available for scientific exploration 
                        (herein public data). The CCRCN also seeks to assist users with data that are not yet public 
                        (herein private data) to participate, and be properly acknowledged in, future data syntheses, through the 
                        creation of downloadable and citable public data releases primarily attributable to the original data contributor(s).
